# PKI and Digital Certificates Project in .NET 8

üîíüîëüõ°Ô∏è

Welcome to the Irno Dome: Public Key Infrastructure Project, where security meets innovation through robust cryptographic algorithms.

## Overview

This project focuses on the study and implementation of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for secure digital communications according to RFC 5280. It includes:

- Generation of RSA key pairs for asymmetric encryption.
- Implementation of Diffie-Hellman for session key exchange.
- Utilization of symmetric encryption for secure data transmission.
- Digital signatures for data integrity and authenticity.

## Features

- **RSA Encryption**: Securely generate and manage RSA key pairs.
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: Facilitate secure key exchange using Diffie-Hellman algorithm.
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Encrypt and decrypt data using symmetric encryption methods.
- **Digital Signatures**: Generate and verify digital signatures for data integrity.
- **BouncyCastle Integration**: Utilize BouncyCastle library for key generation and cryptographic operations.

## Components

- **Certificate Authority (CA)**: Issue and manage digital certificates.
- **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)**: Verify certificate revocation status.
- **Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)**: Maintain lists of revoked certificates.
- **Authority Information Access (AIA)**: Provide access to additional certificate information.

## Installation

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using NuGet, particularly BouncyCastle.
3. Explore and modify cryptographic operations as needed.
